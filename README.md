<h1 align="center">Vim4Helix</h1>

A [Helix](https://helix-editor.com) patch that adds Vim emulation without affecting Helix’s editing capabilities like multi-cursor support and tree-sitter awareness.

## Installation

### Build from Source

To get the latest, build this project from source—just like Helix itself.
[Follow the official Helix build guide](https://docs.helix-editor.com/building-from-source.html)

### Pre-built binaries

Download pre-built binaries from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/badranX/vim4helix/releases/). Then, follow the [official Helix guide](https://docs.helix-editor.com/install.html#pre-built-binaries) for setup steps.

## Features

### Switching between Vim mode and Helix

Vim mode is enabled by default. Use `:vim-disable` and `:vim-enable` to disable and enable Vim emulation.

### Vim Supported Keybindings (Partial List)

#### Visual Mode, Visual Lines, and Visual Block

- Visual mode and Visual lines: `v`, `V`
- `va)`, `vi<textobject>` (`<textobject>`: `w`, `W`, `p`...etc)
- Treesitter-related selection such as `vaf` to select a function.
- `gv`
- Visual Block: `C-v` works similarly to Vim’s _visual block_ mode, but it’s not exactly the same — It simply creates multiple cursors.

#### Operators/Modifiers

- `d`, `dd`, `c`, `cc`, `y`, `yy`
- `[c|y|d]<motion>` like `dw`, `dB`
- `[c|y|d]{textobject}` like `diw`, `da)`, `yi}`
- Treesitter-related modification keybindings such as `daf` to delete a function or `yaf` to yank a function.

#### Navigation

- `*`, `#`, `n`, `N`
- `0`, `^`, `$`
- `f<char>`, `F<char>`, `t<char>`, `T<char>`
- `{`, `}`
- `w`, `W`, `b`, `B`, `e`, `E`
- `gg`, `G`
- `C-^`, `C-6`

### How to Find and Replace?

If you have `sed` on your System, you can use `:s/../../flags` like Vim or `:s|..|..|flags`. You don't need to add `%`, it will default to `:%s` in normal mode and will be applied to the selection in `visual` mode.

However, we advice using Helix multicursor to achive this:

1. **Select target text**
   - For the whole file: `ggVG`
   - You can also remap `select_all`/`vim_select_all` to directly select all text.

2. **Create multicursors**:
   - Press `s`, then type your regex (e.g., `foo`) and hit `<Enter>`. This will put a cursor on all `foo` in the buffer.

3. **Replace using multi-cursor**:
   - Use Vim-style editing. For example, press `c` to change selection, then type your replacement text.

4. **Exit multi-cursor mode**:
   - Press `,` (comma)

### File Explorer/Picker (this is a Helix feature)

- `<Space>e` Open file explorer in workspace root
- `<Space>E` Open file explorer at current buffer's directory
- `<Space>f` Open file picker
- `<Space>F` Open file picker at current working directory

### Things to Watch For

- Helix follows **selection → action** model. This patch simply removes the `selection` part for almost all commands in Normal mode. However, if you need the original Helix behavior of any command, you can wrap it with `vim_cmd_off` and `vim_cmd_on` in your config file:

```toml
[keys.normal]
"A-up" = ["vim_cmd_off", "expand_selection", "vim_cmd_on"]
```

- Helix's `select_all` (`%`) is mapped to `match_brackets`, similar to Vim. `select_all` creates a selection in Normal mode. If you need the command in Vim mode, apply the previous trick or map it to `vim_select_all`.

- `s` is used by Helix for `select_regex` and it's an important command for multi-cursor support. Either use `c` instead of `s` or remap keys.
- `C` is used by Helix for `copy_selection_on_next_line` and it's an important command for multi-cursor support. To get Vim behaviour, map it to `vim_change_till_line_end`.
- To get Helix's `escape` behavior instead of Vim's, you can remap it to the `vim_normal_mode` command:

```toml
[keys.insert]
"esc" = "vim_normal_mode"
```

These differences might be reduced in the future.

## Vim Emulations in Helix

- [vim.hx](https://github.com/mattwparas/vim.hx) — Uses Helix's upcoming plugin system.
- [evil-helix](https://github.com/usagi-flow/evil-helix) — A soft fork of Helix. This project adapts some ideas from evil-helix.
- [helix-vim](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/helix-vim) — Configuration-only changes that bring Helix closer to Vim.
